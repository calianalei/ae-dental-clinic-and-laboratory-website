# Application Development and Emerging Technologies Laboratory: AE Dental Clinic & Laboratory 

**Background of the application and business** 
The AE Dental Clinic & Laboratory, true to its name, operates as both a clinic and laboratory specializing in the field of dentistry. It has a sole branch in Poblacion 1, Moncada, Tarlac and offers various dental services. To enhance accessibility and streamline operations, a website will be developed to incorporate key features of patientâ€™s information and history, service listings, and scheduling capabilities with patient and administrative credentials to ensure controlled access. Visitors to the website will be able to explore detailed information about the clinic and the range of services it provides. Registered users will have the added benefit of scheduling appointments for their desired services upon logging in. For administrative purposes, the clinic owner has requested that the website grant equal access levels to all two dentists and staff members. To simplify management, a single shared administrator account will be used. Administrators will have the ability to view and update patient records as well as manage appointment schedules, ensuring efficient and organized clinic operations. 

**Products and services offered by the business** 
AE Dental Clinic & Laboratory provides a wide range of services and products designed to address various dental concerns. Among their offerings are jacket crowns, which restore the shape, strength, and appearance of damaged teeth. The clinic also provides full ceramics procedures, utilizing ceramic materials to repair and enhance teeth that are damaged, discolored, or misshapen. Alternatively, their full shell metal crown procedure uses metal to replicate the natural shape of a crown. For patients requiring tooth replacement, the clinic offers an assortment of removable dentures tailored to different needs. Orthodontics is another specialty of the clinic, focusing on diagnosing and treating bad bites which commonly require braces or retainers for correction. Additionally, the clinic provides denture repairs to resolve minor issues with existing dentures. Their services also include a list of optional and additional charges, which may apply to certain simple procedures or when extra products are needed. 

**Features** 
The proposed website is designed to improve accessibility and optimize operations by incorporating essential features such as patient information and history, service listings, and scheduling capabilities. Access to these features will be securely managed based on user login credentials, ensuring a secure and organized experience for both patients and administrators. 

1. Patient Information and History 
The administrator will be able to view information and history of the patient for appointments and will have the privilege to edit information when necessary. This will ensure seamless operation compared to traditional practices (pen and paper).  

2. Service Listings 
Visitors to the website, regardless of whether they are logged in, will have access to view services offered by the clinic. This feature allows them to determine if the clinic provides solutions that address their specific concerns. 

3. Scheduling  
When customers log in to their account or create a new one, they will gain access to the scheduling feature, allowing them to book a session with the clinic. Without an account, access to scheduling will be restricted. Customers will be required to fill out a form to provide the necessary details for their appointment. Administrators, on the other hand, will have access to a calendar view of bookings, similar to the interface of Google Calendar, for efficient scheduling and management.  

4. About the Clinic 
Visitors to the website will have the opportunity to explore detailed information about the clinic, including profiles of the dentists and staff members. This feature aims to help visitors become more familiar with the clinic and build trust by showcasing the team behind its services. 

5. Contact and Location 
For concerns and inquiries, contact information will be available with various options to choose from to suit different preferences. Additionally, the address of the clinic as well as its map will be displayed to ensure convenient travel for new and old customers.
